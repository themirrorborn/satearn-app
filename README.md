# ⚡ SatEarn Agent: Earn Sats, Be Sovereign

> A Nostr-native agentic framework for rewarding real-world growth—starting at home.

**SatEarn** is a sovereignty-first system that lets parents, mentors, and community leaders reward children with sats (satoshis) for completing meaningful missions: brushing teeth, acts of kindness, learning about Bitcoin, running a Lightning node—anything that nurtures autonomy, consistency, and care.

No apps. No surveillance. Just intent, trust, and Lightning-fast acknowledgment.

## 🧠 Philosophy

- **Intent as Interface** — You speak. The agent listens and responds.
- **Task as Ritual** — Earn sats for doing what matters, not what extracts.
- **Agentic, Not Appified** — No central app. Just composable tools, ephemeral compute, and protocol-native rewards.
- **Sovereignty Starts at Home** — Built for families, classrooms, and communities reclaiming value on their terms.
